# Continuity Statement

This repository is part of my legacy as an open source contributor. In the event of my death or long-term absence, I wish the following principles to be respected:

* This project should never be removed from public access. It must remain available for anyone to use, learn from, and build upon.
* Anyone should be able to fork, modify, and redistribute this project with no restrictions and for no cost.
* If a willing successor cannot be found and the nominated individuals are uncontactable or unwilling, anyone may adopt and re-upload this project to ensure it continues to be available.

## Successor Nomination
If I am confirmed deceased or uncontactable for three calendar months, I nominate [keyz182](https://github.com/keyz182) as my successor to own this project. Upon taking on this role, they are entrusted with all aspects of project stewardship, including but not limited to:
* Passing on ownership to a new successor if they are unable or unwilling to continue.
* Managing issues and pull requests.
* Making decisions on the project direction.
* Protecting the project's spirit and community.

This transfer of ownership, should it occur, is permanent. It is not intended to be temporary or conditional. Should the original owner return, the successor is not obligated to transfer ownership back. The successor may choose to do so if they wish, but it is not required.

If they are unable or unwilling to take on this role, or cannot be contacted for a period of 1 calendar month, I further nominate [fissioncat](https://github.com/fissioncat) as an alternate successor. They are also entrusted with the same responsibilities.

It is hoped that they will update this document to reflect their stewardship and wishes in a similar vein.

## License Permanence
Whilst no restrictions are placed on my successor changing the licence of this project, it is my wish that the project always remain available under an open source licence which allows for free use, modification, and redistribution. Forks and derivatives are encouraged to do the same but are not required to.

My successor may change the licence if they so wish, but must ensure that as a minimum the final version before their change remains available under the original licence terms.

## Definition of Absence
In this context, I am considered “unavailable” or potentially deceased if:
* I am unresponsive to all public and private communications regarding this project for a period of 3 months
* No verifiable update from me, such as activity on GitHub, social media, or email has been observed

If verifiable evidence of life is found but all communication about this repository is being ignored, a ticket may be raised on the issue tracker requesting the transfer of ownership to the successor or any other individual.

Once this request is raised, a response period of two calendar months shall apply starting from the date this ticket was raised. If this period elapses with no response from me on the transfer ticket, the named successor may automatically take ownership. If the successor is also unreachable for a period of one calendar month, ownership is granted to the user which raised the succession ticket.
