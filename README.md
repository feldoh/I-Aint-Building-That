# I Ain't Building That

Inspired by the excellent too many buttons mod, this mod provides a simple way to hide all the stuff cluttering up the build menus that you're never going to build, so you can reserve all that screen real estate for the 37 types of door that you simply cannot do without.

## Abilities
By popular demand and an open source contribution from the community, this mod now includes the ability to hide abilities as well on a per-pawn basis. This does NOT allow hiding every type of Gizmo, only Abilities for now.
